Data Cleaning: The script starts by removing certain columns from both the training and testing datasets. These columns are identified by the variables ql_index and ql_index_test.
One-Hot Encoding: The script then adds one-hot encoded data to the original datasets. One-hot encoding is a process by which categorical variables are converted into a form that could be provided to machine learning algorithms to improve their performance.
Feature Selection: The script selects all columns from the modified train and test datasets as features for the model. However, it excludes the ‘SalePrice’ and ‘Id’ columns from the features as ‘SalePrice’ is the target variable we want to predict, and ‘Id’ is just an identifier for the houses.
Target Variable: The ‘SalePrice’ column from the train dataset is selected as the target variable y. This is the variable that our model will be trained to predict.
Train-Test Split: The script splits the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model’s performance. The split is done in such a way that 70% of the data is used for training and 30% is used for testing. The data is shuffled before splitting to ensure that the training and testing sets are representative of the overall distribution of the data. The random state is set to 123 for reproducibility of the results.
